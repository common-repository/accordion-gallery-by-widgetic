Create an interactive navigation menu using images.



== Description ==

An effective way to showcase your product images in a compact space is to group them as a slideshow. To go a step further you can allow customers to peek at what's next. This way you can set the right expectations by allowing users to engage with your content freely.

Our app is perfect for displaying many hero images at once. This makes it easier to promote several products or campaigns at the same time. The accordion-style navigation can be toggled between vertical and horizontal directions, giving you more control.



= Save space = 
Replace your predefined hero area with the strip animation, to display multiple items at once.


= Showcase your products = 
Showcase your products using an interactive slider, that groups your items together based on context.


= Interactive navigation =
Display a visual navigator built from featured product images, a title and a unique link. Enable auto-slideshow to increase engagement.
